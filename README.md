# Intro-CS-Final-Project-Text-Analytics
For my introductory CS class, CS5 at Harvey Mudd College, myself and my teammates created a program which takes in a text file of unknown origin and compares it with two trained models. The program scores the text based on its similarity to the two models and picks which model the unknown text is most similar to.
